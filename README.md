# Cocktail App
### Requirements
1. Latest version of NodeJS. 
    If you don't have nodejs click on the link to install it for windows [NodeJS for Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
    If you're using MacOS, here's some instructions I found online [NodeJS for Mac](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html). For linux systems you'll have to look up the instructions yourself. Since, I don't know what distribution you're using. Make sure [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm) is updated as well
2. Latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

### Running the app
1. Clone the repo
2. Open up a terminal and `cd cocktail-app/frontend`
3. Run `npm ci` to install all dependencies for the project
4. Run the react server using `npm start`
5. Go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

### Test out the app
