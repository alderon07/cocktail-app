# Cocktail App
### Requirements
1. Latest version of NodeJS. 
    If you don't have nodejs click on the link to install it for windows [NodeJS for Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
    If you're using MacOS, here's some instructions I found online [NodeJS for Mac](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html). 
    For linux systems you'll have to look up the instructions yourself. Since, I don't know what distribution you're using. 


### Running the app
1. Clone the repo into a folder named cocktail-app
2. Open up a terminal and `cd frontend`
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies for the project
4. Run the react server using `npm start`
5. Type `Margarita` in the search bar and press the `Search` button
6. Verify the results show up
